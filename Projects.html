            <img src="6.JPG" alt="Hand made wooden stamps contraining mix of british and slovak words" style="width: 200px;"><br>
            <p>Translation Zone(s) is a collaborative work by artist/researcher Heather Connelly and artist/curator Karina Cabanikova and has been designed to immerse and engage people in process of translation and explore the condition of Linguistic Hospitality. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur (2008:10), described Linguistic Hospitality as 'where the pleasure of dwelling in the other's language is balanced by the pleasure of receiving the foreign word at home, in one's welcoming house'. With this in mind the game requires you to decode, process, map and translate unfamiliar sounds of a minor language (Slovak) into a shared, major language (English). You are invited to listen closely, to the texture of the words, to tune into the unfamiliar and inhabit the role of host and guest simultaneously. You need to beware of 'false friends' - those words that sound familiar but are used in an entirely different way.</p></li>

            <img src="DD.png" alt="Three projection of inland skater wearing polish army uniform" style="width: 200px;"><br>
            <p>The Digital Diaspora is an exhibition organised in collaboration with Short Circuit and Studio 44.Based on the topics of unity and division this timely project lays particular emphasis on Europe as its arrival marks 30 years of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent overthrow of Communist rule. Providing an opportunity to reflect on the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening up of Eastern Europe, the exhibition also contrastingly takes place during the British Exit from the European Union. Through performative action, immersive and interactive measures, artists’ work directly responds to the current socio-political climate of the continent addressing key issues of migration, borders, territory, cultural identity, belonging and isolation. Most artists in the exhibition reveal a deeply personal connection to their work through direct associations with their cultural backgrounds, personal histories or relationships cultivated over many years of ethnographic research.</p></li>

            <img src="GC.png" alt="Exhibition view" style="width: 200px;"><br>
            <p>Anca Benera and Arnold Estefan expose strategies of power in social, economic, and political contexts. Their research-based art practice is a new form of realism which may be very effective in the post-truth era we live in. Using different kinds of artistic media, new technologies and science they implement new aesthetic in which an artwork is the visual evidence of crimes committed by institutions of power on individual. Benera and Estefan debunk the imposed order and open a space to discuss a change in the future.</p></li>

The Institute carries out a variety of activities and projects – from exhibitions, publications, lectures, and installations to performances.The "QAI/CEE" exhibition also features Radziszewski’s photographs and video works.</p></li>

            <video src="siksa.mp4" controls="controls" width="200px" loop="loop"></video><br>
            <p>SIKSA [PL] is the last representative of the future choreographic punk style revolution. Tender-free rebellion on order. Clickbait controversy. Two-headed artiste, dead-serious with square bass figures. Unqualified NOISE-FITNESS instructor, divides her training in three parts: endurance, strength and combined. The "aerobic freiheit five" developed by her is based on conditions of instability and imbalance and is not adjusted to the individual needs of the participants. The worst publicity for Gniezno since the Baptism of Poland in Magdeburg in 966. Former superheroine.</p></li>
